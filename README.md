# Loan Default Prediction

A machine learning project to predict loan defaults using Random Forest.

## What I did
- Performed EDA and cleaned the data  
- Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest  
- Tuned prediction threshold from 0.5 to 0.4  

## Results
- ROC–AUC: 0.67  
- Average Precision: 0.62  
- Recall for defaults improved to ~72%

## Saved model
The final Random Forest model is stored in:
models/random_forest_model.pkl
